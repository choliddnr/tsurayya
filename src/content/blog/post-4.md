## What is UI/UX Design?

UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design are two of the most often confused and conflated terms in web and app design. And understandably so. Theyâ€™re usually placed together in a single term, UI/UX design, and they are both essential to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline.

## Key Principles of Good UI/UX

*   **Clarity:** The interface should be clear and easy to understand.
*   **Consistency:** The design should be consistent across all pages and screens.
*   **Feedback:** The user should always be aware of what is happening.
*   **Flexibility:** The interface should be flexible enough to accommodate different user needs.
*   **Familiarity:** The interface should be familiar to users, so they can easily learn how to use it.
