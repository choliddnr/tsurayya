## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

## The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a document that identifies four key values and 12 principles that its authors believe software developers should use to guide their work. The four core values are:

*   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
*   **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
*   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
*   **Responding to change** over following a plan
