## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Rather than keeping all the files on a local storage device or hard drive, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

*   **Cost savings:** Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters.
*   **Scalability:** Cloud computing services can be scaled up or down to meet the changing needs of your business.
*   **Security:** Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.
