## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services—from applications to storage and processing power—typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis. Rather than owning and maintaining your own computing infrastructure, you can access these services from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Key Cloud Computing Trends in 2025

The cloud is no longer just about storage and virtual machines. In 2025, the cloud is being transformed by several key trends:

- **AI-Driven Cloud Services:** Cloud providers are embedding artificial intelligence and machine learning into their services, enabling everything from automated resource management to AI-powered analytics.
- **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud:** Businesses are increasingly adopting multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies, using a combination of different cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure to optimize cost, performance, and security.
- **Edge Computing:** As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, edge computing is becoming increasingly important. By processing data closer to where it's generated, edge computing reduces latency and improves the performance of real-time applications.
- **Serverless Computing:** Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. This approach offers greater scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.

These trends are making the cloud more powerful, flexible, and intelligent than ever before, enabling businesses to innovate faster and deliver better experiences to their customers.
