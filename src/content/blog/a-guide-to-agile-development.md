## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

## The Agile Manifesto: Still Relevant Today

The Agile Manifesto, with its four key values and 12 principles, remains the foundation of modern agile development. The four core values are:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## The Evolution of Agile: AI and DevSecOps

While the core principles of Agile remain, the practice of Agile is evolving. Two key trends are shaping the future of agile development:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is becoming an integral part of the agile process, from AI-powered coding assistants that boost productivity to AI-driven analytics that help predict project risks and optimize workflows.
- **DevSecOps:** Security is no longer an afterthought. DevSecOps integrates security into every stage of the development lifecycle, ensuring that products are both secure and delivered quickly.

By embracing these trends, agile teams can not only deliver value faster but also build more secure, high-quality products.
