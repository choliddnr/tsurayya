## Project Overview

This project focused on developing an AI-powered chatbot to automate customer support interactions, providing instant responses to common queries and escalating complex issues to human agents when necessary. The goal was to improve customer satisfaction and reduce the workload on the support team.

## Key Features

*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Ability to understand and interpret user queries.
*   **Contextual Conversations:** Maintaining conversation context for more natural interactions.
*   **Integration with CRM:** Seamless handover to human agents with full conversation history.
*   **Multi-channel Support:** Deployment across various platforms (website, messaging apps).
*   **Analytics & Reporting:** Insights into chatbot performance and user interactions.

## Technologies Used

*   **AI/ML:** TensorFlow for building and training the NLU model.
*   **Backend:** Node.js for the chatbot's core logic and API.
*   **Communication:** WebSocket for real-time, bidirectional communication.
*   **Database:** MongoDB for storing conversation logs and user data.

## Challenges and Solutions

Training the NLU model to accurately understand diverse user queries was a significant challenge. We addressed this by collecting and annotating a large dataset of customer interactions and continuously refining the model through iterative training. Ensuring seamless integration with existing CRM systems required careful API design and robust error handling.

## Results

The AI chatbot successfully automated a significant portion of customer support inquiries, leading to faster response times and improved customer satisfaction. The support team could now focus on more complex issues, increasing overall efficiency.
