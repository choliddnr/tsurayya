  - img "AI Chatbot for Customer Support"
  - heading "The Challenge" [level=3]
  - paragraph: A rapidly growing e-commerce client was struggling to keep up with the increasing volume of customer support inquiries. Their support team was overwhelmed, leading to slow response times and a decline in customer satisfaction. They needed a solution that could provide instant, 24/7 support for common questions while freeing up human agents to handle more complex issues.
  - heading "The Solution" [level=3]
  - paragraph: "We developed a custom AI-powered chatbot designed to integrate seamlessly with their existing CRM and support workflow. The solution was built on a foundation of powerful, open-source technologies:"
  - list:
    - listitem:
      - strong: "Natural Language Understanding (NLU):"
      - text: We used
      - strong: TensorFlow
      - text: to build and train a sophisticated NLU model on a large dataset of the client’s actual customer interactions. This allowed the chatbot to understand user intent with high accuracy.
    - listitem:
      - strong: "Real-time Communication:"
      - strong: Node.js
      - text: and
      - strong: WebSockets
      - text: were used to create a real-time, bidirectional communication channel, enabling fluid and natural conversations.
    - listitem:
      - strong: "Scalable Backend:"
      - text: The chatbot’s core logic was built on a scalable Node.js backend, and
      - strong: MongoDB
      - text: was used to store conversation logs for continuous improvement and analysis.
  - paragraph: The chatbot was designed to handle a wide range of common queries, from order tracking to return policies. For more complex issues, it would seamlessly escalate the conversation to a human agent, providing them with the full conversation history for context.
